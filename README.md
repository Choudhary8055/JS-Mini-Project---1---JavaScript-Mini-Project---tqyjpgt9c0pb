         2 CSS-- CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen 
                  size.
                -->  CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document
                -->  CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed  
                --> With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what  background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!  

            ---> CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:   
                Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
                Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section   
                External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

               3- JavaScript-->
                  Defination-->
                                JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
            -->In javascript we use formvalidation concept  for input filds

            -->Using DOM-->  
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
